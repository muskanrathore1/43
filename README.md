Implement Pagination and Sorting for Book API

Summary:

This implementation covers a basic full-stack book management system with pagination and sorting features. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handles the CRUD operations, pagination, and sorting. The frontend, developed with React, provides a user interface for interacting with the backend, displaying paginated and sortable book lists.

Running the Project:

1. Backend:
   
   Navigate to the 'backend' directory.
   
   Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
   
   Create a '.env' file with your MongoDB URI.
   
   Run 'npm start' to start the server.

3. Frontend:
   
   Navigate to the 'frontend' directory.
   
   Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
   
   Create a '.env' file with the API URL.
   
   Run 'npm start' to start the React app.
